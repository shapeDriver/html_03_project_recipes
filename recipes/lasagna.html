            <li>
                Pre-heat the oven to 275 deg C.
                Fry minced meat and smoked pork untill properly browned.
                Cut onions and carrot into small diced cubes and fry in the
                olive oil for 10 min. Add crushed garlic at the last minute.
                Once softened, add tomato, spices, salt and cook the sauce 
                with lid on for 15 min, then reduce without lid for 20 min.
                Add the honey and red wine and cook for 5 further minutes.
                Set aside for the assembly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make a roux of butter and flour. Then add half of the milk,
                whisk untill nicely blended and add the rest. Cook untill 
                thickened and add the parmesan and nutmeg. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add some cheese sauce at the bottom of the pan, then
                cycle plates, bolognese and cheese sauce. Top the last plates
                with cheese sauce and some extra parmesan. Put in the oven for 15
                minutes, then lower the temperature to 225 deg. C and cook 
                15 minutes more. Let the lasagna rest and serve with a nice sallad.
